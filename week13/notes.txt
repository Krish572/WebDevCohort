Better to know: 
npm intall -D nodemon => here -D refer to the dev dependencies, which means these are just for the development purpose and not used in production.
We actually install Tailwind in same way, since we don't want entire css bundle push into production which makes our app bulkier. 
When ever we install css and npx Tailwind which gives us tailwing config file where we need to represent where we are using css predefined class. what ever classes we used in those files will be generated by the tailwind in separate file - index.css(In order to make our app light)
